# vision-utils

Provides utilities for writing and interacting with Vision apps from the Rust programming language, including:

- Runtime [API bindings](https://github.com/Vision-DAO/vision-utils/blob/main/src/actor/mod.rs) for Rust.
- A [procedural macro](https://github.com/Vision-DAO/vision-utils/blob/main/vision-derive-internal/src/lib.rs) for generating bindings for Rust message handlers.

Extensive documentation on these two components can be found [here](https://vision-1.gitbook.io/vision-utils/).
